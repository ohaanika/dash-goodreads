Even the ridiculous money-scrounging episode of La Monte Young's was contributed with permission - as is the wealth of excerpted scores and letters reprinted here. This is a true wealth and document of its times, and any aspiring artist/composer/figure fascinated by the avant-garde collective in America (and Toronto!) will find this essential reading.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Legitimate criticism has been outlined already by this - you wouldn’t guess the ending without cheating a bit - and of course, this would be consumed by its vastly more successful incarnation, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.<br/><br/>But for all its shortcomings, one persistent quality shines through, and that’s the earnestness of a bugger who’s managed to mesh together childhood influences into something that teeters on the edge of rhapsodic nostalgia. The Centipede Press edition is a short, small thing, and the author’s note doesn’t quite go into detail in the way the reader might care for, but it’s evident that care and pride went into this novel, and it’s definitely worth a check out. <br/><br/>Just, you know, don’t get hung up on the excessive purple prose. Both the novel and the movie place the emphasis on the inherent melancholy of cartoons over the saturated societal faults of detective fiction. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

More frustrating, too, is the early writing’s admission on not being quite as eloquent as others, which ends up undermining his relationship with the audience/reader in terms of scrutinization. <br/><br/>It is an honest effort and one that is readily welcomed; slight editing and restructuring (such as the use of “sonic cinema” and its explanation) could help bolster the argument some.

It makes for relatively smooth reading (as much as smooth can be when dealing with specific interludes of children's interjections), but as a result, everything inhabits a turgid, lifeless air about it. That doubles with small excerpts from other authors, whose snippets enlighten the reading and make a clear difference already in terms of diction.<br/><br/>(Might try to revisit one day, and not speed through it like some sort of demon; perhaps that reading might illuminate more for me than this cursory one did.)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It yields its best treasures then, and the most singular treasure that I took from it was Woodmass' singular voice. It remains consistent and engaging throughout the entirety of this collection, and - to my delight - it is firm in resisting affectation.<br/><br/>At the same time, my preferences in poetry lie with the paring of words, and ultimately the layout of the copy I have in my hands. Since its initial release on Lulu Press, Inc., I know Woodmass has created a second edition, one which i think is a bit shorter in dimensions, and with a different cover. I'm not sure in what ways the poems may differ - if indeed they do - but I can imagine the spacing and layout will differ slightly. I mention this particularly because I do think Woodmass' words intend to be savoured, sometimes in slight breaking of pages and on their own merits. The copy I have does stagger a bit in terms of spacing (most notable in ""A Return Home""), so I think my initial rating reflects that a bit here.<br/><br/>More so in this collection, the same redolent themes appear in different incarnations - perhaps to the point of excess. That may very well be the point, but it does nag at me briefly to see the same gesture (trees and roots as a comparative note towards one's self-growth and self-value; the value/reverse value of ""Triggers"") without a pause, or a new variation that allows to re-examine the conclusions in earlier works with a more pronounced light. Her writing, too, almost demands to both gulp down its content and to stay a breath's distance away, which might be more to do with how the material here is organized. Again, preference counts - you as the reader may find difference with me here, and that I think would be highly encouraged.<br/><br/>Regardless of all this errata I've typed here, I do think Rebecca Woodmass has cultivated a voice all her own - her Instagram presence, as well as her continued work in support of raising awareness, attest to that, and in triumphant strides of self-development. Coming soon, as she's teased on Instagram, is her second collection. I look forward, eagerly, to its arrival.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Writing “raw” and pulped with emotion also runs the risk of saying absolutely nothing. <br/><br/>This book does a good job at letting the reader overlay their emotional reaction onto the words themselves, but - and perhaps tragically so - the poems themselves don’t amount to anything, independent of the reader who attributes themselves into these etchings. <br/><br/>What made Warsan Shire’s poetry work is a writing identity; that kind of identity that gives Shire’s work context (“this is the everyday,” one might intuit) and thus a sense of credibility. In Kaur’s collection, no such context exists: you’d have to read her foreword, included in an exclusive hardcover edition, to understand that she intended to write in lowercase as a nod, and as ode to Gurmukhi (“a script in which punjabi is written only uses the period,”(sic) notes Kaur). Does that translate well into the poems at hand? Not to my reading. <br/><br/>The failure of this work is a sum total of ambition and raw excess. It seems more clear to me that this is the work of someone who has experienced heartache of a massive kind, and has come out the better for it through writing. I won’t fault that - Kaur mentions she is already much different now than she was when she wrote milk and honey. But a published work is very different in evaluation from that of a personal journal, and the ideas here begin to attain shape more as personal mantra than an act of transformation. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The first few pages are remarkable, but the brunt of the tale is mired with description of so much offal that it becomes tiresome, and worse, tedious. Perhaps it speaks to our Age of Information that what used to be outrageous in print now seems like crude exercise to the blasphemy of online erotica?<br/><br/>In the end, reading through this piecemeal has helped to appreciate - and probably mystify - the book a bit better. I can imagine why Matthew Barney would find this material attractive, and it's material worth visiting, even if in the end it is too wildly varying in tone to recommend. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

(Consider a lot of the women in this comic - they end up subservient to male desire. It's a result of the time period, but one can't help recall the likes of Fritz Lang's The Big Heat when reading into these interactions.)<br/><br/>The only real comment I'd have to give to justify a 4-star rating is that the pacing does kind of wobble in places (I'm thinking particularly of the endgame pacing, and of the sudden ""aha"" revelations that occur just a bit too often).

The different art styles don't really help the matter, and aside from the (very nice) afterword explaining the genesis of the idea, we as readers don't really get much in the way of ""outline-to-product.""<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of how some artists render their anatomy, either; frequently in the midpoint of the book, some characters look as though they've been sketched out without regard for muscle tone in arms and legs, so their ""arms"" tend to look more like limp noodles. Hey, it happens - but this isn't an anthology, and it would have been nice to kind of get an explanation in-book as to why. <br/><br/>The story itself teeters toward fluff and mock-epic - I wouldn't be surprised if Neil Gaiman was a frequent inspiration for some of the later plot points. Ultimately, though, I do think that iZOMBIE got carried away with so many supernatural elements added into the mix, and the TV series (as weird as this is to say) actually made the right decision in moving away from the original material, to focus specifically on the zombie angle. <br/><br/>Both are worth checking out, in the end; I'm not quite as enamoured with the comic series as I was with the first season of the TV show, to be honest, but they both have different goals in mind. Interestingly enough, their biggest strengths, despite being so strongly different in plot and themes, are also the same - there's just a lot of good old raunchy humour. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

What does come off, in this translation, is a very moving tribute to the nature of contemporary art, and Yasmina Reza really does let her characters rip into it every chance she gets. The only qualm is that, for all of the build-up, the ending does deflate a little. It's a good ending on paper, and thematically so, but the asides to the audience throughout and leading to the ""epilogue"" don't particularly serve as good pay-off for an incredible rest of the work.<br/><br/>To be fair, this is a rather spectacular and remarkable work, and it deserves merit for equally standing on its own and shining in the hands of others.

They're a fantastic band, and the book is absolutely worth getting if you're a die-hard fan.<br/><br/>This rating is more for the casual listener who might have stumbled upon this book by pure chance (although I would be heavily surprised, to be quite frank, if one does) - it's a little too colored, in my opinion, by pure idolatry for its cast, and lots of the recollections come off as pure ""fan fiction"" with imagined dialogues and sitcom-esque scenarios. Perhaps a more steady editing process, or a more detached style, would have come across as a bit more natural and less hysterical. But, then, with a more detached perspective, one would probably lose a lot of interesting tidbits, and the tidbits are really what make this book interesting.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of speculation in journalism, so I suspect that is why I've been so cool towards this publication - but, rest assured, I do recommend it for those interested in the band.

Ursula K. LeGuin's two-part anthology, The Unreal and the Real, didn't seek to bridge all stories through chronology or by generic categorization (Application / Language / Perception), but by applying care in selecting how her stories would be read. Here, in contrast, many of the ""whammy"" moments that often tend to clarify speculative fiction (and, let's face it, short stories belonging to ""general fiction,"" whatever that may be) are somewhat lessened by a lack of separation. <br/><br/>This last part is really a subjective tenet of mine, however, so take from it as you will. This is a great collection, my complaints notwithstanding, and deserves reading - and thinking, and reading, and thinking again long after your eyes have left the last ink blot on the last page.
